This is a project I am going back to try and practice ruby using tdd. 

## From User Stories to a Domain Model

Here is a user story:

```
As a user, 
So I can find customers,
I want to search for my customers by their surnames.
```

And here is a functional representation of that story:

Objects  | Messages
------------- | -------------
User  | 
Customer  | find_by_surname
